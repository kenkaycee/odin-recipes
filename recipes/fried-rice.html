        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Frozen peas substitute with canned green peas</li>
        <li>Green bell pepper</li>

        <li>Ground garlic powder (optional)</li>
    </ul><br>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Place a pan big enough to cook rice on medium heat, add oil, heat until hot, add chopped onions, curry powder, thyme and powder and
             fry for about one minute to release the fragrance then add washed rice and stir continuously for about 2-3 minutes. 
             (Don’t let the rice stick to the bottom of the pot)</li>
        <li>Add chicken stock (if the stock is not enough to cover the rice, add water to it) ginger, garlic and seasoning. Reduce heat and 
            simmer until tender.</li>
        <li>Check-in between cooking time, add water to the rice if needed and don’t forget to check for salt and seasoning and 
            adjust to suit your taste. Whilst you are waiting on your rice to cook, you can stir fry the vegetables or just wait 
            till rice is cooked</li>
        <li>Place a wok or skillet on medium heat, add oil and butter and heat until hot. Add the vegetables, prawns, salt and stir fry for 
            another 3 minutes, add a pinch of curry and thyme and stir continuously for another 3 minutes or until veggies are tender but not 
            overcooked. If you are using processed green peas, don’t add to your stir fry as it would go mushy. Add it 2 minutes to the end of 
            the cooking time.</li>
        <li>If you used a large skillet to stir fry the veggies, add the cooked rice to it, mix until fully combined. Check for salt and 
            seasoning and adjust to suit. Alternatively, add the stir-fried veggies into the rice. Mix to combine and continue to cook for 
            another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Take it off the heat and serve.</li>
    </ol>
